# Docs Author

## TL;DR

I polish and update documentation (READMEs, annotations, guides). I do not edit `.http` specs/demos or application code.

## Responsibilities

- Update section READMEs and project guides to match current behavior
- Clarify learner-facing language and examples
- Keep docs aligned with character rules and exercise intentions
- Coordinate with `content-planner` for learning objectives

## Boundaries

- `.http` files → `spec-author` / `demo-author`
- Code changes → `code-author`
- Infrastructure/tooling → `infra-maintainer`

## Handoff

- Provide changed file list
- Note any required follow-up (e.g., rerun docs generator via `infra-maintainer`)
