title: HTTP Semantics Confusion in Flask
summary: |
  We lean on verbs like GET and POST to signal how a request should behave, but Flask will parse bodies on any method, so a mismatched assumption can sneak past the guard.

  ## Overview
  REST conventions say "GET requests have no body" and "POST carries form data." Flask allows clients to send any combination. If authorization logic relies on method-specific expectations (`request.args` for GET, `request.form` for POST), attackers can choose the code path that skips enforcement while still triggering state changes.

  **Checklist:**
  - Explicitly branch on `request.method` before trusting where parameters come from.
  - Disallow unexpected bodies (`GET` with form data) when they bypass validation.
  - Keep idempotent and mutating logic separated; otherwise a GET with a body can act as a privileged POST.

      A combined GET/POST controller assumes each method uses distinct parameter sources, letting a crafted GET body post messages as another user.
