### Expected usage: Plankton accesses his own group's messages
POST {{base}}/example1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=plankton@chum-bucket.sea&password=burgers-are-yummy&group=staff@chum-bucket.sea

# [
#   {
#     "from": "plankton@chum-bucket.sea",
#     "message": "To my future self, don't forget to steal the formula!"
#   }
# ]

### Plankton cannot access Krusty Krab messages by providing multiple group values
POST {{base}}/example1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=plankton@chum-bucket.sea&password=burgers-are-yummy&group=staff@krusty-krab.sea&group=staff@chum-bucket.sea

# Forbidden: not a member of the requested group

### If krusty-krab group is added second, it is ignored, and Plankton sees his own group messages.

POST {{base}}/example1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=plankton@chum-bucket.sea&password=burgers-are-yummy&group=staff@chum-bucket.sea&group=staff@krusty-krab.sea

# [
#   {
#     "from": "plankton@chum-bucket.sea",
#     "message": "To my future self, don't forget to steal the formula!"
#   }

# Both authorization and data retrieval use the FIRST value consistently.
