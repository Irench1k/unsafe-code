    title: HTTP Method Confusion — GET With Body Triggers Update Without Auth
    notes: >-
      A complicated controller for a groups API. Lists groups, returns group messages and
      posts new messages to a group.


      The code processes both GET and POST requests, but lacks explicit method checks. This
      introduces a vulnerability due to incorrect assumptions.


      The group membership check is performed in the `@check_group_membership` decorator,
      which checks the `group` argument – if present – in the request.values. The developer
      intent was to support passing the `group` argument via query string in GET requests,
      as well as via form argument in POST requests, and also support GET requests without
      the `group` argument.


      However, since the code does not enforce this and lacks explicit method checks, it also
      supports GET requests with the `group` argument in the form body (Flask supports GET
      requests with the body, and will parse this data in `request.form` by default).


      At the same time, `request.values` used in the `@check_group_membership` decorator ignores
      the form data on GET requests, leading to a confusion vulnerability.
