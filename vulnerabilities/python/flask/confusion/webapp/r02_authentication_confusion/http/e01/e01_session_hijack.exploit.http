### Mobile app still uses Basic Auth for user authentication
GET {{base}}/orders
Authorization: Basic plankton@chum-bucket.sea:i_love_my_wife

### But on the web app there is a login form that sets a session cookie
# Plankton logins into his own account
# This request sets the session cookie that will be automatically added in the followup requests
POST {{base}}/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "email": "plankton@chum-bucket.sea",
    "password": "i_love_my_wife"
}

### Plankton accesses his own orders via cookie authentication
GET {{base}}/orders

### However, Plankton wonders what would happen if he sends the request with Basic Auth and a session cookie
# He tries to access Spongebob's orders without knowing his password
GET {{base}}/orders
Authorization: Basic spongebob@bikinibottom.sea:no_password

#### If we access account info, we see that we are logged in as Plankton
#/account/info
GET {{base}}/account/info
