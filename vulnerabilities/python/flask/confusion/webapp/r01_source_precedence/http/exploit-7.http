### Squidward logs in using form body (BEST PRACTICE - credentials not logged in URLs!)
POST {{base}}/example7
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=squidward&password=clarinet123

# Results in 200 OK:
#
# {
#   "owner": "squidward",
#   "messages": [
#     {
#       "from": "mr.krabs",
#       "message": "Squidward, I'm switching yer shifts to Tuesday through Saturday. No complaints!"
#     },
#     {
#       "from": "squidward",
#       "message": "Note to self: Mr. Krabs hides the safe key under the register. Combination is his first dime's serial number."

### Despite using secure form-body authentication, the endpoint is still vulnerable!
POST {{base}}/example7?user=spongebob
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=squidward&password=clarinet123

# Results in unauthorized access:
#
# {
#   "owner": "spongebob",
#   "messages": [
#     {
#       "from": "patrick",
#       "message": "SpongeBob! I'm ready! I'm ready! Let's go jellyfishing!"
#     }
#   ]
# }
#
# Squidward accessed SpongeBob's messages! Using form body for auth is best practice,
# but request.values in retrieval still merges query+form parameters.
