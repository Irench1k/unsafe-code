### Message API looks more secure this time, it's a GET request and the username is only sent once
GET {{base}}/users/me/messages?user=squidward&password=clarinet123
# {
#   "owner": "squidward",
#   "messages": [ ... ]
# }

### Generally, GET requests shouldn't have a body, but Flask doesn't prevent it and still parses request.form
### Here, Squidward remains able to access SpongeBob's messages:
GET {{base}}/users/me/messages?user=spongebob
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=squidward&password=clarinet123
# {
#   "owner": "spongebob",
#   "messages": [
#     {
#       "from": "patrick",
#       "message": "SpongeBob! I'm ready! I'm ready! Let's go jellyfishing!"
#     }
#   ]
# }
