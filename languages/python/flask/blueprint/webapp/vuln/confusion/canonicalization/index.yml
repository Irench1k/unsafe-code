    title: Lowercase Normalization
    notes: >-
      This example demonstrates a canonicalization confusion vulnerability using inconsistent
      lowercase normalization.


      The vulnerability occurs because:


      1. Users can create new groups with any casing (e.g., "STAFF@KRUSTY-KRAB.SEA"), making
      themselves admins


      2. During group membership checks, the group name is NOT normalized/lowercased


      3. When retrieving group messages, the group name IS normalized to lowercase


      Attack scenario: Attacker creates a group "STAFF@KRUSTY-KRAB.SEA" (uppercase) and becomes
      admin. When checking membership, system looks for "STAFF@KRUSTY-KRAB.SEA" (finds attacker's
      group). When retrieving messages, system normalizes to "staff@krusty-krab.sea" (finds
      legitimate group). As a result: Attacker gains access to messages from the legitimate
      group they shouldn't see.

    title: Case insensitive Object Retrieval
    notes: >-
      In this example we are still using case canonicalization for group retrieval, but now
      instead of showing the attacker the victim's group content, we are showing the attacker's
      newly created group content to the victim, allowing impersonation.


      The vulnerability occurs when an attacker creates a new group with the same name as
      the victim's group but uses different casing.During group creation, the system checks
      for exact name matches to enforce uniqueness, so "STAFF@KRUSTY-KRAB.SEA" is considered
      different from "staff@krusty-krab.sea" and creation succeeds. However, during group
      retrieval, the system performs case-insensitive matching and returns the most recently
      created group that matches. When the victim tries to access their original group "staff@krusty-krab.sea",
      they actually receive the attacker's group "STAFF@KRUSTY-KRAB.SEA" because it was added
      later and the case-insensitive lookup treats them as the same group.


      This vulnerability allows the attacker to impersonate legitimate group members and post
      messages that appear to come from trusted colleagues or administrators, potentially
      leading to social engineering attacks and information disclosure.

    title: Whitespace Canonicalization
    notes: >-
      This is a classic whitespace confusion attack - two parts of the code handle whitespace
      differently: - strip() only removes leading/trailing whitespace - replace(" ", "") removes
      ALL whitespace


      So here's what happens: - @check_group_membership uses strip() - sees "staff @krusty-krab.sea"
      and keeps the middle space - example20 uses replace() - turns "staff @krusty-krab.sea"
      into "staff@krusty-krab.sea"


      The attack: Plankton creates "staff @krusty-krab.sea" (with space), gets authorized
      for HIS group, but the code actually fetches messages from "staff@krusty-krab.sea" (Mr.
      Krabs' group).
