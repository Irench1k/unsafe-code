title: Canonicalization Confusion Vulnerabilities in Flask
summary: |
  This directory contains examples demonstrating various patterns of canonicalization confusion vulnerabilities in Flask applications. These examples show how inconsistent canonicalization can lead to security vulnerabilities.

  ## Overview
  Canonicalization is the process of transforming data into a "standard" form, for example, when you paste your email with the first upper case letter most of the email providers will convert it to the lower case, e.g. "Example@mail.com" -> "example@mail.com".

  Canonicalization confusion occurs when an application uses the canonical form inconsistently, for example, it might be only used when accessing data but not during the security checks.
