    title: Basic Parameter Source Confusion
    notes: >-
      Demonstrates the most basic form of parameter source confusion where authentication
      uses **query** parameters but data retrieval uses **form** data.


      We take the user name from the query string during the validation, but during the data
      retrieval another value is used, taken from the request body (form). This does not look
      very realistic, but it demonstrates the core of the vulnerability, we will build upon
      this further.


      Here you can see if we provide bob's name in the request body, we can access his messages
      without his password.

    title: Form Authentication Bypass
    notes: >-
      The endpoint uses form data for authentication, but request.values.get() allows query
      parameters to override form values, creating a vulnerability. Although designed for
      POST requests, the endpoint accepts both GET and POST methods, enabling the attack.


      Note that although the regular usage would rely on POST request (or PUT, PATCH, etc.),
      and wouldn't work with GET (because flask's request.values ignores form data in GET
      requests), the attacker can send both GET and POST requests (if the endpoint is configured
      to accept both methods).


      ```http

      POST /vuln/confusion/parameter-source/example6? HTTP/1.1

      Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

      Content-Length: 26


      user=alice&password=123456

      ```


      However, the attacker can send both GET and POST requests (if the endpoint is configured
      to accept both methods).

      We start by copying the previous implementation and changing the function body to iterate
      over all the groups in the request.


      The code looks clean and works nicely for the "happy path", but it is vulnerable as
      the function body now acts on the unverified data – remember that `@check_group_membership`
      only checks the first group in the request.

    title: Motivation for using path and query parameters [Not Vulnerable]
    notes: >-
      We move to authorization rather than authentication vulnerabilities, so for the following
      examples the authentication will be done reliably and safely, via the `Authorization`
      header (based on Basic Auth and handled in the `@basic_auth_v1` decorator). We also
      follow the best practices by storing the authenticated user in the global context (`g.user`).


      Imagine that at this point we have many `/groups/` and `/user/` endpoints for creating,
      updating and deleting groups, users and messages.


      When the endpoint needs to work with a specific group, this could be passed as a query/form
      argument as in the previous examples, but if the `group` argument is required, it might
      be more idiomatic to make it a path parameter instead.


      Here we will work with two endpoints, the `/groups/<group>/messages` which will return
      the messages from a specific group (taking the `group` from the path) and the `/user/messages`
      which will return the user's private messages by default, but also supporting an optional
      `group` query argument.

      We try to fix the root cause of the vulnerability here by enforcing correct merging

      one of the two can be present.


      The code, however, remains vulnerable despite these efforts! This time, the problem
      is that the `@check_group_membership_v2` decorator is applied too early – before the
      `@basic_auth_v3` decorator which is responsible for setting the `g.group` global variable.
      This makes `@check_group_membership_v2` a no-op.

    title: HTTP Method Confusion — GET With Body Triggers Update Without Auth
    notes: >-
      A complicated controller for a groups API. Lists groups, returns group messages and
      posts new messages to a group.


      The code processes both GET and POST requests, but lacks explicit method checks. This
      introduces a vulnerability due to incorrect assumptions.


      The group membership check is performed in the `@check_group_membership` decorator,
      which checks the `group` argument – if present – in the request.values. The developer
      intent was to support passing the `group` argument via query string in GET requests,
      as well as via form argument in POST requests, and also support GET requests without
      the `group` argument.


      However, since the code does not enforce this and lacks explicit method checks, it also
      supports GET requests with the `group` argument in the form body (Flask supports GET
      requests with the body, and will parse this data in `request.form` by default).


      At the same time, `request.values` used in the `@check_group_membership` decorator ignores
      the form data on GET requests, leading to a confusion vulnerability.
