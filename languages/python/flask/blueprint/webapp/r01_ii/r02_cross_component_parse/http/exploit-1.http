### Expected Usage: Secure baseline showing correct authentication
GET {{base}}/example1?user=spongebob&password=bikinibottom
#
# SpongeBob authenticates and gets his own messages:
#
# {
#   "owner": "spongebob",
#   "messages": [
#     {
#       "from": "patrick",
#       "message": "Hey SpongeBob, wanna go jellyfishing?"
#     }
#   ]
# }
#

###

### Attempted Attack: Try to authenticate as SpongeBob but access Squidward's messages
GET {{base}}/example1?user=spongebob&password=bikinibottom
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=squidward
#
# This FAILS to bypass authentication because both the decorator and handler
# consistently use request.args.get("user"). The form data is ignored by both layers.
#
# SpongeBob still gets his own messages, NOT Squidward's:
#
# {
#   "owner": "spongebob",
#   "messages": [
#     {
#       "from": "patrick",
#       "message": "Hey SpongeBob, wanna go jellyfishing?"
#     }
#   ]
# }
#
# SECURE: The consistent parameter sourcing prevents authentication bypass.
