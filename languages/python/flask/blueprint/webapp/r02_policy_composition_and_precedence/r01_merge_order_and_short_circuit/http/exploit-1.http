###
# The group authorization is completely ineffective because `@check_group_membership_v2`
# is applied too early, and `g.group` is not set yet.
#
# As a result, Plankton can access the Krusty Krab's messages without any tricks:
GET {{base}}/groups/staff@krusty-krab.sea/messages
Authorization: Basic plankton@chum-bucket.sea:burgers-are-yummy
# Results in the sensitive data disclosure:
#
# [
#   {
#     "from": "mr.krabs@krusty-krab.sea",
#     "message": "I am updating the safe password to '123456'. Do not tell anyone!"
#   }
# ]
