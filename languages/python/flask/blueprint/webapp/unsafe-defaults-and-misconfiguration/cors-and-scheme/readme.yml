title: CORS and Scheme Misconfiguration
summary: |
  Configuration sets wrong `PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`, permissive CORS allowlists, or missing proxy config, enabling credential leakage and CSRF.
description: |
  ## Overview
  This is a **configuration mistake**: setting `PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME` incorrectly when TLS terminates upstream, copying dev `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` lists to production, or enabling `supports_credentials=True` with permissive CORS rules. These misconfigurations **enable** trust boundary errors by making the framework misunderstand the deployment topology (thinking HTTP when it's HTTPS) or allowing browsers to send credentials to attacker origins.

  **Contrast with [Trust Boundary > Origin & Scheme Assertions](../../trust-boundary-errors/origin-scheme-assertions/)**: That category covers the **code pattern** of trusting scheme/origin values. This category covers the **config mistakes** that make those values incorrect or too permissive.

  **Practice tips:**
  - Tie CORS allowlists to deployment configs and review them alongside firewall changes.
  - Require HTTPS verification before enabling secure cookies or redirect logic.
  - Validate scheme and origin behavior with integration tests that simulate hostile origins.
