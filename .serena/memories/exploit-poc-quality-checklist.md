# Exercise Quality Checklist

Quick-reference for reviewing exercises (code + demos).

## 🔥 The "Heart Attack" Test (CODE REALISM)

**Would a developer reading this code think "I've written code exactly like this"?**

### Copy-Paste Progression
- [ ] Bug pattern exists in 2+ endpoints (not isolated)?
- [ ] Working version of the pattern exists nearby?
- [ ] Developer would copy from working → broken naturally?

### Infrastructure Justification
- [ ] Existing helpers/APIs make the "wrong" choice reasonable?
- [ ] Developer's decision looks like code reuse, not negligence?

### Bug Distribution
- [ ] Vulnerability spans multiple pieces (not one "bad function")?
- [ ] Authorization separate from processing?
- [ ] Each piece looks correct individually?

### "Works for 1, Breaks for N" Pattern
- [ ] Single-item version of pattern works correctly?
- [ ] Batch version fails due to same pattern?
- [ ] Difference is subtle (not obvious)?

## 🎭 Character Logic (DEMOS)

- [ ] Attacker uses THEIR OWN credentials, not victim's
- [ ] Right attacker for target (Squidward→SpongeBob, Plankton→Mr.Krabs)
- [ ] SpongeBob is NEVER the attacker
- [ ] All characters established in database

---

## 📈 Progressive Complexity

- [ ] Only ONE new concept per exercise
- [ ] Builds on previous exercise's patterns
- [ ] Code organization matches pedagogical goal

---

## ✍️ Annotation Style (DEMOS)

- [ ] Behavioral ("SpongeBob accesses messages") not jargon
- [ ] From student/attacker perspective
- [ ] One line when possible
- [ ] Impact summary only if adds unique value

---

## 🎯 Variety Check

- [ ] Not same impact as last 3 exercises?
- [ ] Different attacker/victim/method/function?
- [ ] Appropriate variety for sequence position?

---

## 📖 Narrative Flow (DEMOS)

- [ ] Credentials match character role?
- [ ] Story arc: setup → attack → verification → impact?
- [ ] Makes sense to first-time student?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why Bad | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| Auth + processing in one function | Too easy to spot | Separate into different files/functions |
| Bug only in vulnerable endpoint | No copy-paste narrative | Add working endpoints with same pattern |
| ORM convenience hides pattern | Makes code too "smart" | Use explicit lookups |
| Developer choice looks negligent | No "I'd write this" moment | Justify with existing infrastructure |
