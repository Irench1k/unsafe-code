# PoC Quality Checklist

Quick-reference for reviewing .http exploit files.

## Character Logic (CRITICAL)

- [ ] Attacker uses THEIR OWN credentials, not victim's
- [ ] Right attacker for target (Squidward→SpongeBob, Plankton→Mr.Krabs)
- [ ] SpongeBob is NOT the attacker
- [ ] All characters established in database

## Progressive Complexity

- [ ] Example 1-2: Full URLs (no `@base`)
- [ ] Example 3+: `@base` ends one segment short
- [ ] Only ONE new concept per example
- [ ] Code organization matches pedagogical goal

## Annotation Style

- [ ] Behavioral ("SpongeBob accesses messages") not jargon
- [ ] From student/attacker perspective
- [ ] One line when possible
- [ ] Impact summary only if adds unique value

## Variety Check

- [ ] Not same impact as last 3 examples?
- [ ] Different attacker/victim/method/function?
- [ ] Appropriate variety for sequence position?

## Narrative Flow

- [ ] Credentials match character role?
- [ ] Story arc: setup → attack → verification → impact?
- [ ] Makes sense to first-time student?
